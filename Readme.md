This is a Python command-line application that solves linear equations of the form ax + b = c,
 where a, b, and c are constants and x is a variable.

Requirements
To run this application, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download 
the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Usage
To use the application, simply run the equation_solver.py script from the command line.

The application will prompt you to enter an equation in the format ax + b = c, where a,
 b, and c are floating-point numbers and x is a variable. You can enter multiple equations, 
one after the other, until you type "q" to quit the application.

The application will print out the equation, as well as the steps it takes to solve the equation
 and the value of x. If the equation has no solution or an infinite number of solutions, 
the application will print an appropriate error message.


Conclusion
This is a simple but useful application that can help you solve linear equations quickly and easily.
 It's a great example of how Python can be used to implement complex algorithms in a concise and 
readable way. I hope you find it useful!
